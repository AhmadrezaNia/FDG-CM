# "This repo is for presenting the algorithm we have developed in the FDG_CM ( Previously named FTL-TP) paper "
Note the code is not completed yet!!!

The paper has been accepted to the JMS journal. This alogirhtm is a novel federated domain generalization algorithm that is especially used in condition monitoring of manufacturing processes. The paper is currently under review in the JMS journal.
You can find the Client codes and Server codes in the src folder.
For running all the client codes you can execute the run.py file in this folder. Also, you can modify Run.py only to execute desired clients on each edge device. Please pay attention that you need one CPU core for each client node. Fo example for running 16 clients you will need 4 Raspberry pis each with 4 CPU cores.
